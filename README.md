# SQL_RFM-Segmentation
🔹 Project Overview  This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to understand customer purchasing behavior and identify high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers. The analysis was performed using PostgreSQL on transactional retail data.

🔹 Objective
The main objectives of the project were to:
Segment customers based on how recently, how often, and how much they purchase
Perform country-level RFM segmentation to avoid cross-country bias
Identify high-return / problematic customers using negative quantity analysis
Find most profitable customer–product combinations
Generate insights that can support targeted marketing, retention strategies, and profitability improvement

🔹 Dataset Description
The dataset contains retail transaction-level data with the following key fields:
Invoice number and date
Customer ID
Product (StockCode, Description)
Quantity and Unit Price
Country
Returns and cancellations are represented using negative quantities.

🔹 Methodology
RFM Metric Calculation
Recency: Days since the customer’s last purchase (relative to the latest invoice date in the dataset)
Frequency: Number of distinct invoices per customer
Monetary: Total revenue generated by each customer
Country-Level Segmentation
RFM scores were calculated within each country using window functions (NTILE)
Customers were benchmarked only against peers in the same country
Customer Segmentation
Customers were classified into segments such as:
Champions
Loyal Customers
Potential Loyalists
At Risk
Lost Customers
Return Behavior Analysis
Identified customers with high return activity using:
Return transaction count
Return ratio
Return value
Customers were flagged as Low, Medium, or High Return Risk
Profitability Analysis
Identified the most profitable product (StockCode) for each customer based on total revenue contribution

🔹 Key Insights
High-value customers were clearly distinguishable using RFM segmentation
Return behavior was concentrated among a small subset of customers
Country-level RFM provided more accurate and fair customer comparisons
Certain products consistently generated the highest revenue per customer


Who they are
Buy recently
Buy frequently
Spend the most
Low return behavior
